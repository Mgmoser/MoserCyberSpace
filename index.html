	<h2 style="color:#53BDFF">Who am I?</h2>
	<p>I am a Cyber Security Analyst with over 3 years experience. I have special interests in Social Engineering, OSINT, Blue Teaming, Red Teaming, and programming. Languages I am familiar are Python, PowerShell, HTML, CSS, and C#.</p>
	<dl>
		<dt><h2>HTML Websites/h3></dt>
  		<dd>I wrote all the HTML for this website. Although CSS, templates and services can make it easier to create a website fast, it is handy to understand basic HTML.</dd>
		<dt><h3>PowerShell File Management</h3></dt>
  		<dd>Everyone always wants to immediately learn advanced PowerShell commands and don't spend enough time on the basic commands. Most users will never understand how powerful PowerShell is for managing your computer's files!</dd>
		<dt><h2>VIM and Why Its More Important Than You Think</h3></dt>
		<dd>VIM is super useful once you master it and because it doesn't require a GUI it is the best for more efficient programming and computer administration!</dd>
		<dt><h3>Creating My Team's Own PowerShell Module</h3></dt>
  		<dd>Publically available modules are great, but they can always solve your specific work problems. You can write a script, but then everyone has to version them and install them regularly. With a PowerShell module your team can contribute and easily install and update your custom module!</dd>
